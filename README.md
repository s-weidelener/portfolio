# Portfolio Project

**Status: Work in Progress (WIP)**

This project is part of my journey to becoming a Software Developer. It serves as a practical foundation to apply my skills in web structure, styling, and logic.

##  Current Focus
- **Clean HTML Structure:** Learning how to build semantic and accessible web pages.
- **CSS Styling:** Experimenting with layouts, animations, and modern design (e.g., glow effects).
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the site works on different screen sizes.

##  Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript 

##  Note
As this is a learning project, the code is subject to frequent changes and refactoring. I am currently using this repository to document my progress and test new concepts during my vocational training preparation.
